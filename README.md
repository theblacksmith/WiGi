WiGi
====

A C# .Net MVC 4 Wiki which uses Git for storing file history.

## What we've got so far

- A nice installer
- User registration / login
- Registration via Open Id
- Restrict registration to Open Id domain
- Markdown and Razor support for pages
- Page parser pipeline (a page.md.cshtml will be parsed by razor and then by markdown)
- Auto update of pages edited elsewhere
- Directory page listing
- Page list widget
- Default directory page

## What we still need

- Settings management page (currently done only during install and app settings)
- Web editor for pages
- Documentation
- Tests!
- Page history viewer
- Conflict resolver
- Service Hooks (to receive notifications when a commit is pushed to the remote repo) 
- Support for templates
- Plugin API
- Search

## Though about helping?

### Please, do!
